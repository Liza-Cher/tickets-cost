For an online conference, you need to write a program that will calculate the total cost of tickets. The program should work as follows:

1. At the beginning, the user is asked for the number of tickets he wants to purchase for the event.

2. Next, for each ticket, the age of the visitor is requested, according to the value of which the cost is selected:

If the conference visitor is under 18 years old, then he goes to the conference for free.
From 18 to 25 years — 990 rubles.
From 25 years — the full cost of 1390 rubles.

3. As a result of the program, the amount to be paid is displayed. At the same time, if a person registers more than three people for a conference, they additionally receive a 10% discount on the full cost of the order.
